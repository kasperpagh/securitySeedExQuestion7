2 known vulnerabilities, 2 affecting installed version

Minification can change the behaviour of code
Specially crafted Javascript files, when minified, have a behaviour change that could allow malicious code to be hidden within secure code.

Affected versions: <= 2.4.23

Regular Expression Denial of Service
Some types of input can result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)

Affected versions: <2.6.0

## HOW TO USE

Start with installing all dependencies using npm install

Then left click www and run it (bin folder)

Then type localhost:3000 in your browser to find index.html

We did not get the angular to work properly so you have to test the methods using postman this way;

### Loggging in
```JSON
API PATH : localhost:3000/login

{
	"userName" : "llama",
	"password" : "bubber"
}

```
